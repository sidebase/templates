# create-sidebase templates

This repository contains all base templates required to run [`create-sidebase`](https://github.com/sidebase/create-sidebase).

The template is based on the [Nuxt3 Starter template](https://github.com/nuxt/starter/tree/v3).

## Versioning

Every branch contains the template for a specific Nuxt version. This template creates a new sidebase project with the required Nuxt version. This is to ensure that older instances of the starter will still properly set up the project.
